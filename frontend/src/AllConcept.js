// In Signup page we are using two things cloudinary and toast from chakra UI 
// Cloudinary:

// Description: Cloudinary is a cloud-based service that provides end-to-end image and video management. It offers various features for storing, managing, optimizing, and delivering images and videos for web and mobile applications. Developers can use Cloudinary to upload, transform, and serve media files, reducing the complexity of handling media assets in their applications.
// Use Cases: Cloudinary is commonly used in web development to handle image and video assets, including tasks like resizing, cropping, optimizing, and delivering media efficiently.
// Toast in Chakra UI:

// Description:Toast
// The toast component is used to give feedback to users after an action has taken place.
// Use Cases: Toast notifications are often used to provide feedback to users about the success or failure of certain actions, such as form submissions or background processes. They appear briefly and then disappear, helping to keep the user informed without being disruptive.
// In summary, Cloudinary is a service for managing media assets, while Toast in Chakra UI is a UI component for displaying notifications in React applications.

// a toast is a small, non-intrusive notification that appears on the user's screen to provide feedback or information without blocking the user's workflow. User Feedback:
// Toasts are often used to provide immediate feedback to users after they perform an action. For example, a toast might appear to confirm that a form submission was successful.
// Error Handling:

// Toasts can be used to display error messages or warnings in a non-intrusive way. Instead of interrupting the entire user experience with an alert or modal, an error toast can inform the user about a problem while allowing them to continue using the application.

{/* <Text display={{ base: "none", md: "flex" }} px={4}>
  Search User
</Text>
In summary, this code sets up a responsive behavior for the visibility of the "Search User" text:
On screens smaller than the default (base) breakpoint (display: "none"), the text will not be displayed.
On screens equal to or larger than the medium (md) breakpoint (display: "flex"), the text will be displayed as a flex container. */}
